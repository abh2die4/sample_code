Oauth 2.0 Client Credential - using CURL
----------------------------------------

Ensure the Connected app and the user created is configured correctly
1) Create an API only user: If you have not already done so, create an API only user in Salesforce.
2) Assign the connected app to the API only user: In the Connected Apps section of Salesforce, under the Manage Policies section, and set the "Run As User" field under "Client Credentials Flow" section to the API only user you just created.
3) Enable the client credentials flow: In the Connected Apps section, edit the connected app, and make sure that the "Enable Client Credentials Flow" checkbox is checked.
4) Check the API permission: In the Connected Apps section, make sure that the API permission for the connected app is set to "Full access."
5) Verify the API user has the correct profile: The API only user must have a profile that has the "API Enabled" permission.
